# My Data Science Projects
Medical Data Normalization & Fuzzy Matching

Overview
This Python script automates the cleaning, standardization, and matching of medical diagnoses using fuzzy string matching and an abbreviation dictionary. It processes raw patient diagnosis data, replaces abbreviations, and applies fuzzy matching (Levenshtein distance) to improve consistency before storing the results in an SQLite database.

Features
Data Cleaning: Expands abbreviations and corrects inconsistencies in medical diagnoses.
Fuzzy Matching: Uses fuzzywuzzy (or rapidfuzz) to match similar diagnoses from different sources.
SQLite Integration: Reads and updates patient records efficiently in a structured database.
Customizable Abbreviation Dictionary: Easily extendable to handle additional medical terminology variations.

Why This Matters
In clinical research and medical data management, inconsistencies in diagnosis data can affect analysis and decision-making. This tool streamlines data preparation, ensuring better accuracy for downstream processes like querying, reporting, and machine learning applications.
